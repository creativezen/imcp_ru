                                    <p>Misha Saidov started his journey in psychology at a remarkably young age. At just 14, he hadstarted out on a path unlike most teenagers, taking an interest in Neuro-LinguisticProgramming (NLP), the most popular psychological methodology at the time. Under theguidance of Frank Pucelik, one of NLP's founders, Misha's unyielding curiosity andintellectual resolve made him earn his first certification at the age of 17.</p>

                            <blockquote>This was a milestonethat marked the beginning of his career in coaching.</blockquote>
                            <p>Misha's pursuit of understanding human behavior and psychology extended beyond NLP,leading him to explore more evidence-based modalities such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy(CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).</p>
                            <blockquote>He didn't just learn; he dissected thesemethodologies, scrutinizing them with the aim of finding out how effective they were.</blockquote>
                            <p>Despite his passion for psychotherapy, Misha Saidov doubted the financial viability of beinga coach. So, driven by the sense of responsibility to support his family, he transitioned intothe corporate world, ascending the ranks as a marketing and sales executive. However, thisdid not stifle his passion for psychotherapy; it merely laid the foundation for his eventualentrepreneurial journey.</p>
                            <p>Even as a high-performing C-level executive, Misha's heart was rooted in transforming livesthrough coaching. At age 30, he already had hundreds of sessions under his belt, even thoughthe financial returns could have been better. Eventually, Misha Saidov’s curiosity about themost effective psychological approach led to him merging various methodologies, birthingthe concept of Metacognitive Programming (MCP). This groundbreaking frameworkcombines practical knowledge, theoretical background, and transferability, aiming to makecoaching more effective by harnessing the commonalities among the different modalities.</p>
                            <blockquote>This unique perspective laid the foundation for the innovative coaching model that underpinshis Institute of Metacognitive Programming (IMCP) today.</blockquote>
